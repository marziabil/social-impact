Like nostalgia to me seeing land with trees removed be it for farming or lumber along side roads with woodland. If it were a woodland by my yard being landscaped for farm land, I’d be upset as I know a small ecosystem has been removed. So generally it would appear slightly upsetting to me and also it calls me to inquire more about tree removal, like I feel there’s nothing I could do to fix anything related to tree removal. However the image makes my lens my focus to some introspection about my own experiences being around small wooded areas being removed. ","I think the subject of this image is about the grossness of tree removal for utility purposes such as building a power line or deer hunter cabin area.  Also it gives a sense of loneliness and trauma, like there’s the single damaged tree. Also the trees look young so it could be from a tree farm thing. The image gives me a depressing ink press ion, like I feel it has a powerful effect if one contemplates the image, however I feel I couldn’t or wouldn’t want to look at the image much. ","Reduce single-use plastic consumption;Makes me want to try and use fewer single use plastic items. But mostly makes me want to keep using very little harsh cleaners such as water detergents, It makes me feel like I should try to maybe plant a few plants even if it just makes me feel slightly like I’m being more productive. Yet I feel helpless like I can’t make much of a change given my confusing and complicated life. ",I’m unsure ,Neutral,Neutral,To a limited extent - The artwork minimally increased my awareness.,"The artwork made me feel frustrated, because I feel like I’ve seen lots of art like this with before, I find the artwork theme depressing. Maybe someone else would find it bringing more awareness to them. ","I think the art work may be about neurodivergency. I personally have Autism Spectrum disorder and have seem some artworks like this one. I’ve seen some with scrambled lines which I find very depressing. Yet I found this particular artwork slightly more appealing from the colors, also it could be about neurodivergent people or a form of self portraiture. ","I’m unsure, I personally feel like stories could help with mental health awareness, such as themes.  I feel like I want to make my own art cover subjects of mental health. It also inspires me to want to give my own perspectives on ASD in research study surveys. ","It think it’s probably powerful as it is. I feel like there could be additional paintings using different colors side by side that look similar with slightly different face shapes, to show a sort of contrast between people’s perspectives.
